The purpose of this site is threefold:
- To have a good time coding
- To develop my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- To gather all my knowledge about bodybuilding in one site.
(In no way do I pretend to be a professional, a state graduate, an expert or that you should follow my advice)

Nothing else.
